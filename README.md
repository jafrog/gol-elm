# What is it?

It's a little interactive [Conway's Game of Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life) simulator.

# What to do with it?

Click on cells to mark them as "alive" or "dead". Run and stop a simulation using play / pause buttons. "Zoom" in or out using plus and minus buttons. Clear the state using "Undo" button.

Go ahead, make a [glider](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glider_(Conway%27s_Life)), play with diff patterns it's quite entertaining.

# Technology

It's written in [Elm](http://elm-lang.org) and intended as an excercise in Elm. Hence the implementation is quite naive, so CCW is very welcome.
